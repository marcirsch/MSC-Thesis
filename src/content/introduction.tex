A prerequisite for future expansion of mobile robots is the ability to navigate autonomously and safely in their ever-changing
environment without collision. The positioning of drones in ad hoc indoor environment where no infrastructure is available is 
needed to fulfill this prerequisite. To know the position of a robot in an unknown environment, the robot needs to build a map
if its surroundings so its position can be referenced. Mapping and positioning were considered as two separate problems 
at first and research focused on either of them, but the solution to these problems separately proved to be divergent. Only 
by considering these two problems together and finding solutions simultaneously, it became convergent 
\cite{durrant2006simultaneous}. This process is referred to as Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).

The proposed issue by SLAM has many solutions depending on the use-case. SLAM technique can be used to with a 
focus on improving localization accuracy in GPS degraded environments, by fusing the outputs of a SLAM algorithm with GPS and
IMU data \cite{hening20173d}. Or as presented in \cite{droeschel2018efficient}, the solution focuses on building highly accurate maps
of building interiors or even outdoors online, but as a byproduct position becomes more accurate as well. The above mentioned 
papers present a mapping approach that uses industrial-grade hexacopter and octocopter and the same precise LIDAR scanner that can
measure up to 100m. 

Localization and mapping of the environment for a small quadcopters can be challenging, because adding any extra equipment means
extra weight that shortens flight time and changes flight behavior. Adding the above mentioned 3D LIDAR scanner that weighs 830g
to a quadcopter that is under 1kg means significant extra weight and the drone might turn out to be uncapable of flying. These
scanners use LIDAR sensors spinning around the horizontal axis to provide ranging measurements on 360$^\circ$. The
stepper motor used for spinning the sensors that could also affect the flight behavior, because a spinning weight acts like a 
gyroscope. Monocular, stereo or RGB-D cameras can be placed even on small aerial vehicles and therefore offer a great solution.
These visual sensors however produce higher amount of data by magnitudes, but still needs to be considered for such purposes,
because highly detailed maps can be created by using them.

By using stationary 1D LIDAR sensors placed around the quadcopter, these unwanted effects can be eliminated and the weight of 
extra equipment can be kept significantly lower, than using a 3D LIDAR scanner discussed before. The sensors need to be placed
in a layout that offers an optimal scan of the environment, therefore the movements of quadcopter during flight needs to be 
taken into account to be able to scan the environment around the vehicle.

In this thesis the design of a 3D positioning and mapping system is being discussed, that uses stationary 1D LIDAR sensors to 
acquire distance measurements from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's (UAV) surrounding and uses SLAM technique to map its 
surrounding, estimate its position and velocity. The goal is to provide a lightweight hardware and software alternative to 
accurate planar LIDAR scanners, that are too heavy both computationally and physically for a UAV under 1kg. The focus during 
the design is on the quality of the map and accuracy of the position estimates.

In chapter \ref{chap:literature_review} basic aviation terminologies are introduced that will be used in the thesis, followed
by introduction of SLAM techniques and similar products on the market. Visual SLAM techniques describe the use of monocular 
cameras, stereo cameras or RGB-D cameras to be used for data acquisition, while ORB-SLAM and LSD-SLAM are two popular SLAM
techniques for processing data coming from these sensors. Ranging sensors are non-visual sensors that can use sound
or light to measure distance, like ultrasonic sensors or LIDAR sensors. Two interesting researches are discussed, that use 
LIDAR scanners to improve position or map quality online. Cartographer SLAM is a is a software package that will be used
for the first prototypes and to evaluate layout design of the stationary sensors, because it has compatibility with ROS
system.

In chapter \ref{chap:simulation} software components and their interaction is discussed, that will be used for future 
simulations. Simulations help to evaluate sensors, layout designs and SLAM algorithms without the need to build the system
physically.

The last chapter \ref{chap:system_design} gives an overview of the chosen LIDAR sensor for the first prototype, first designs 
of the layout of stationary sensors and a unit for collection of measurements from the sensors.
