\section{TeraRanger}
TeraBee offers an off-the-shelf solid-state LIDAR system with the purpose of collision avoidance. In this 
solution 8 sensors are positioned around a vertical axis with a controller board in the middle. TeraRanger's
interface is compatible with PixHawk 4 flight controller board and PX4 flight controller software that makes
integration easy.

Each block of the array is a standalone LIDAR sensor, that can be used separately and supports different
mount configurations. The company offers a long-range and fast-ranging version of these sensors, depending 
on the type an update rate of 320 Hz can be achieved. The fact that system comes with a ROS package and a 
2° field of view, in the original placement makes it a good candidate for indoor mapping in two dimensions.
